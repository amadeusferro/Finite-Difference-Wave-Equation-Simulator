# 🌐📡 Wave Simulator in Python

Welcome to the **Wave Simulator in Python** repository! This project uses the Finite Difference Method to model wave propagation in various media.

## 📜 Description

This project simulates the Wave Equation, a fundamental second-order partial differential equation used to describe how waves propagate through different environments. The simulation helps visualize wave behavior in various scenarios, including interactions with obstacles like slits.

### 📐 Finite Difference Method

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) numerically solves differential equations by approximating derivatives with finite differences. In this project, it discretizes the spatial and temporal domains into a grid, converting the Wave Equation into algebraic equations. Using a second-order approximation for greater accuracy, the simulation iteratively updates grid values over time. This approach models wave propagation and visualizes how waves interact with obstacles, such as in the double-slit experiment, revealing detailed interference patterns.
